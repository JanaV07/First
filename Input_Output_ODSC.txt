I also came through the same scenario where I have to update the TrustManager of my spring Boot App on the fly. Let me share my findings :

 1. I uploaded the certificate to my default cacert file(i.e Default SSL Context TrustManager) - This will take care of the connections establishing through default SSLContext.
 2. But I also have two different REST Template Beans,One for establing 1way/Mutual SSL Connection and another for 2Way SSL Connection. Since these Beans got initialized during the startup 
      - changing the default TrustManager will not update the TrustManager of REST Template.
      - For this I updated the RestTemplate Bean with the new Request Factory dynamically which solved my issue.
